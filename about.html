      <h1>What is an IP Address?</h1>
      <p>
        An <strong>IP Address</strong> (Internet Protocol Address) is a unique string
        of numbers separated by periods or colons that identifies a device
        connected to a computer network, including the Internet. It serves as
        the address that allows devices to communicate with each other by
        sending and receiving data.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are two versions of IP Addresses:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4)</strong>: Uses 32-bit addresses, typically written in dot-decimal notation, such as <em>192.168.1.1</em>. It supports about 4.3 billion unique addresses.</li>
          <li><strong>IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6)</strong>: Introduced to address the limitation of IPv4, it uses 128-bit addresses written in hexadecimal, like <em>2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334</em>. IPv6 provides a virtually unlimited number of unique addresses.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        IP Addresses are classified into different types:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Public IP Address</strong>: Assigned to devices that connect to the Internet directly. It is unique globally.</li>
          <li><strong>Private IP Address</strong>: Used within private networks, such as homes or offices, and cannot be accessed from the Internet.</li>
          <li><strong>Static IP Address</strong>: A fixed address assigned manually.</li>
          <li><strong>Dynamic IP Address</strong>: Assigned automatically by a network using DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol).</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        Without an IP Address, communication between devices on a network or
        accessing the Internet would not be possible. It acts as a unique
        identifier for each device, ensuring data is routed correctly.
